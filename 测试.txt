This study examines which components of an evaluation system are related to the effects of the evaluation system on professional development from a teachersâ€™ perspective. 
Components such as leadership characteristics, the purpose of evaluation and features of the evaluation system are included in the study. Data regarding a representative sample of 1983 teachers from 65 Flemish schools were collected by ques-tionnaire. The outcomes of multilevel analyses suggest that limited experience (<5 years) and useful feedback  are  positively  related  to  outcomes  of  the  teacher  evaluation  system  on  professional development.
