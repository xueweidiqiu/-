2.  Theoretical framework
Our theoretical framework consists of several elements which have been identiﬁed in the research literature as inﬂuential for good teacher evaluation (i.e.  teacher evaluation that stimulates teachers to improve or develop professionally). A ﬁrst critical factor is the purpose of an evaluation system. There is agreement among several authors that teacher evaluation needs to serve a double cause:  on  the  one  hand  accountability and  on  the  other hand improvement (e.g. Colby et al., 2002; Stronge, 2006). In this regard, it is important to notice that a teacher evaluation system that is establishedtomainlymotivateteachers will have adifferentimpact on professional development than a teacher evaluation system that mainly aims to hold teachers accountable (Conly & Glasman, 2008; Stronge, 2006). Additionally, principals’ leadership features can be an  inﬂuencing  factor in  the  evaluation  of  teachers  (Tuytens,  & Devos, 2010). Principals can use teacher evaluation as a catalyst for  the  improvement  of  teaching  and  instruction  (Davis  et  al., 2002).  According  to  Marks  and  Printy  (2003),  both  trans-formational  and  instructional  leadership  are  important  for  the improvement of the behaviorand instructional practice of teachers. A principal’s positive or negative attitude toward teacher evalua-tions can have an impact on the effects of a teacher evaluation system (Peterson & Peterson, 2006). Other inﬂuencing features of the evaluation system are the fairness of the evaluation system, the clarity of evaluation criteria and purposes and the satisfaction of teachers  with  their  performance  and  evaluation  interviews (Tuytens & Devos, 2009; Giles & Mossholder, 1990). We will ﬁrst discuss these elements and their importance for teacherevaluation. Secondly, wewill focus onprofessional development as anoutcome of teacher evaluation.
